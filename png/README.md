# Will Legionnaires' disease be the next US epidemic?

**Motivation**
“To do something helpful in the time of Covid.”     
With office buildings being closed during the Covid-19 Pandemic (stagnant water), could this make conditions ripe for a Legionnaires' outbreak?  Is there a correlation between water system violations and increased Legionnaires' cases?

**Initial Questions:**  

Will Legionnaires' be the next US epidemic?  
Have water system violations increased over time?  
Is there a correlation between the two?

**Data**

While typically Legionella has colonized in buildings like hotels and hospitals - office buildings along with other buildings that have been shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic, may now pose a new risk for outbreaks.
