# In the last 10 years water system violations and waterborne diseases have been on the rise. Is there a correlation?

**Motivation**
“To do something helpful in the time of Covid.”     
With office buildings being closed during the shutdown (stagnant water), could this make conditions ripe for a legionnaire’s outbreak? What systems do we have in place to protect the American people from the next preventable epidemic? Is there a correlation between water system violations and increased waterborne illnesses in America? Does this disproportionately affect low income communities and communities of color?

**Initial Questions:**  
Will legionnaires be the next US epidemic?  
Have water system violations increased over time?  
Have waterborne illnesses increased over time?  
Have clean water regulations increased? Decreased? How does this   affect the number of violations?  
Is there a link between lower quality water care and low income cities/regions? - and is there also a link to communities of color?
What demographic of people are most vulnerable to legionnaires?   
Are states requiring the flushing of water tanks at facilities that haven’t been in use?
